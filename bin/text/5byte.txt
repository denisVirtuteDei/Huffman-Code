The United States sets aside a number of days each year to commemorate events, people or public occasions. These days are called holidays. Technically, the United States does not celebrate national holidays, but Congress has designated 10 legal public holidays, during which most federal institutions are closed and most federal employees do not work. Since 1971, a number of these have been fixed on Mondays, so as to afford workers a long holiday weekend.

There are a number of traditions for weddings that have survived into the 21st century. It is still traditional for the bride and groom to have their own parties the night before getting married. The grooms party is called a Stag party, while the brides is known as a Hen party. On the morning of the wedding, the groom should not see the bride. If he does, this is bad luck. The bride puts on her special wedding dress, which is usually white. She also needs to wear something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue. At the church, or registry office, the bride and groom exchange rings before walking together back down the aisle. When they get outside, the bride throws her bouquet in the air. Tradition says that whoever catches it will be the next person to get married. But its not only the bride who throws something. All the people at the wedding throw confetti and rice over the happy couple. Finally, after the reception, the bride and groom drive off to have their honeymoon.

What makes every American a typical one is a desire to get a well-paid job that will cover their credit card. A credit card is an indispensable part of life in America. In other words, any American knows that how he or she handles their credit card or cards, either will help them or haunt them for years.

In the U.S. getting a card isnt as hard as it used to be. Some companies now mail applications to high school students, rather than waiting for them to get into college. At their best credit cards allow their owners to reserve hotel rooms, rent cars and finance larger purchases over several months. At their worst, cards allow people with poor money management skills to get into a high-interest debt.

For those who are deep in credit card debt, there are some Credit Services agencies that offer anyone in America both online or telephone, and face-to-face counseling. The counselors may propose a debt management plan. The plan includes lower interest payments for clients and setting up a pay off timetable. The agencies average client makes about 32,000 dol. a year and has more than 16,000 dol. debt in the program. Usually the agencies charge zero up to 30 dol. monthly to manage the debt service plan.

Credit Services counselors advise, that if an American gets divorced, he or she may eliminate all joint debts by paying them off or transferring debt into a one-name account. Even in happy marriages, the agency advises that the husband and wife should each have a credit card in their name only to establish separate credit histories.

Once debts have been repaid, an American can re-establish his or her good credit by applying for a secured credit card and paying the balance off regularly. A store credit card usually is the next step, followed by applying for a major credit card such as a Visa or MasterCard.
