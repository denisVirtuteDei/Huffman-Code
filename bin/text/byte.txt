The United States sets aside a number of days each year to commemorate events, people or public occasions. These days are called holidays. Technically, the United States does not celebrate national holidays, but Congress has designated 10 legal public holidays, during which most federal institutions are closed and most federal employees do not work. Since 1971, a number of these have been fixed on Mondays, so as to afford workers a long holiday weekend.

Seven of the federal legal holidays New Years Day, Washingtons Birthday, Presidents Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas are observed nearly universally throughout the public and private sectors They are considered to be American favorite holidays.

A number of states also celebrated the February 1 the birthday of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president. Some legislators advocated combining the two events into a single holiday. Many Americans now call the holiday Presidents Day, to honor both Washington and Lincoln or all presidents.
